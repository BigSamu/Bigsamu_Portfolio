    Hey there! 👋 I'm Samuel, a curious engineer and lifelong learner 🤓, always eager to explore new ideas and technologies. My career bridges strong engineering fundamentals, finance experience, and modern full-stack software development 🚀.

    My journey began with a Bachelor's Degree in Engineering 🎓 in Chile 🇨🇱, where I built strong foundations across math ➕, physics 🌎, mechanics 🛠️, electricity ⚡, finance 💰, and programming 👨‍💻. That exposure sparked a deep interest in computing 💻, which ultimately shaped the direction of my career.

    After early roles in global tech companies and investment banking 🏢🏦, I decided to fully commit to software engineering — completing a Full-Stack Bootcamp and later earning an MSc in Computer Science in the UK 🇬🇧. Since then, I’ve focused on building scalable systems and high-impact products.

    I'm experienced across a wide range of full-stack technologies 💻, with a particular passion for TypeScript and Python — especially when building applications with React and FastAPI 🙌. Currently, I work as a Staff Software Engineer at Synopsys 🏢, where I lead the development of scalable React + TypeScript UIs ⚛️ and contribute to Python-based microservices 🧪 as part of an initiative to decompose legacy monoliths into a modern, modular architecture 🏗️. I also mentor engineers and help elevate frontend and backend best practices across the team 🌟.

    Throughout my career, I've consistently combined strong technical execution with clear communication and leadership 🤝 — designing systems that are robust, maintainable, and thoughtfully engineered. I’m particularly driven to deepen my expertise in Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI — applying analytical rigor and scalable engineering principles to build intelligent, data-driven systems.
